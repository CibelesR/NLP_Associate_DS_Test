    "pipe.predict(['and the computer that ran the first public Bulletin Board Systems, CBBS]]A Bulletin Board System, or BBS, is a computer system running software that allows users to connect and login to the system using a terminal program. Originally BBSes were accessed only over a phone line using a modem, but by the early 1990s some BBSes allowed access via a Telnet or packet radio connection.Once a user logged in, they could perform functions such as downloading or uploading software and data, reading news, and exchanging messages with other users. Many BBSes also offered on-line games, in which users could compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often offered IRC-like chat rooms, allowing users to meet each other.In recent years, the term BBS is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to any online forum or message board.During their heyday from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s, most BBSes were run as a hobby free of charge by the system operator (or \"sysop\"), while other BBSes charged their users a subscription fee for access, or were operated by a business as a means of supporting their customers. Bulletin Board Systems were in many ways a precursor to the modern form of the World Wide Web and other aspects of the Internet.Early BBSes were often a local phenomenon, as one had to dial into a BBS'])"

Lastly, it is decorated with the lemon and straw, after stirring with bar spoon smoothly.[2]Most variants use equal parts of the main liquors, but include a smaller amount of triple sec (or other orange-flavored liqueur). Close variants often replace the sour mix with lemon juice, replace the cola with diet cola or actual iced tea, or add white crème de menthe. Most variants do not include any tea.The drink has a much higher alcohol concentration (approximately 22 percent) than most highball drinks due to the relatively small amount of mixer.'])"

    "pipe.predict(['Un Té Helado Long Island es un tipo de bebida alcohólica mezclada hecha típicamente con, entre otros,vodka, ron blanco, triple seco, y ginebra.1​ Se llama así debido a su parecido con el color y el sabor del Té helado (Camellia sinensis). Una versión popular mezcla partes iguales de vodka, ginebra,ron, y triple seco con 1½ partes de sour mix y un toque de refresco de cola, lo cual le da a la bebida el mismo color ámbar de su fundador. La mayoría de las variantes usan partes iguales de los licores principales, pero incluye una parte pequeña de triple seco (u otro licor sabor naranja). Variantes cercanas reemplazan seguido el sour mix con jugo de limón, el refresco de cola con uno de cola de dieta o té helado, o agregan crema de menta; sin embargo, la mayoría de las variantes no incluyen té. Algunos restaurantes substituyen brandy por el tequila. Algunas variantes de la bebida tienen nombres alternativos como lo son Texas Iced Tea, Georgia Iced Tea, Tokyo Tea, Three Mile Island, y Adios Mother Fucker. La bebida tiene una más alta concentración de alcohol (aproximadamente 22 por ciento) que la mayoría de los cocteles debido a la relativamente pequeña porción de soda. El Long Island puede ser ordenado extra largo, con un mayor incremento de alcohol en la mezcla.'])"

just put some caveats, namely that this therapy is not necessarily a brief therapy, i know from experience. some patients are progressing greatly and can certainly get away with very cheap with few months of therapy, but not the majority. and i would testify that, if you do not get results fairly quickly, there is the risk (because it works emotionally) to become addicted to therapy and stagnate for years. there was even harder to get that stephen is really charismatic, more than can suggest his book. and he and his acolytes (not bad either) are so convinced and therefore convincing, and are

know more or less. one of the major interests of the work of patrick baudry and resides in the angle of approach chosen, and in particular its desire to focus primarily on the pornographic video. in cinephile, he is extremely careful to play the camera that it shows what she grows, she forgets; authorize plans to transition from sequence to sequence, but also, that is more courageous and more stimulating ways to see induced in the viewer. the book is extremely rich, sometimes repetitive, sometimes so obscure, as in my case, it is not introduced to authors such as levinas, and we do not really understand the meaning of a phrase like \\'the body of the body the other \\'. but even without that structure continues to be interesting because this particular color that condenses the term of involvement \\'- a term necessarily empty, but a good text, as it manages to expand over the pages, failing to clear it. avoiding the trap of bourdieuseries somewhat mechanical focuses solely on the legitimacy of porn (especially in his opposition to the eroticism), he points the finger of the strong porn, that any viewer can experience (and it is too subtle to wear to demonstrate the generality of this reading, leaving memories play drive to a kind of empathy). pornography is thus for him a \\'form of media coverage of the immediate\\', including the cancellation of any narrative. everything must be visible, spread, and the film plays more like \\'support\\', it can be viewed upside down, on a poorly defined: this is not of a contingency related to poor producers, but a repetition and boredom that feed the success of the genre. this is aptly he rejects the idea of provocation or rebellion driven by porn: one of his secrets is just not involved, to say nothing. the radius of regret, we must be careful to call what he justifies the absence: no analysis of different genres, very few references to specific films or little analysis of the marking of bodies placed in sets according sex, age ... porn is just a wish for reconciliation and peace that minimizes the significance of these distinctions. by cons, it might be regretted that the term \\'world\\' is not sufficiently developed, including a treatment perspective of space. and especially since patrick baudry has also worked on cities. thus a passage where he mentions a sex shop located right next to a bus stop: it emphasizes the open demonstration of serious people waiting for the bus, their desire to avoid potentially ambiguous complicity, then it fits him even inside the sex shop and sets his eyes on the images where everything is given immediately, without further ado. his writing reminds extremely suggestive steps of richard sennett in the streets of new york and it came almost to regret that patrick baudry not prolong this evocation of the sociability of sex shops where he came so easily and so pleasure. theme that has been treated by cons in a much more extensive, but often with less subtlety, by the anglo-saxon writers, including gay (michael warner, for example). anyway, the writing of patrick baudry, delectable, many households also remarks that make the book very rich and most importantly, it had the merit of choosing an angle of approach is highly relevant, and never fall into facilities or clichés that litter the course yet (bulk: place of desire, sexual liberation

gas chambers and the holocaust, if this is also an attempt to recover the horror attached to it? what i take from this book is that, as the authors say in the introduction, the consequences of the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture on human health are very difficult to establish, let alone quantify (this book did not help that matter) and the chemical industry profits. besides this, the book tries to make us understand the workings of political decisions and to denounce corruption that prevails there. i confess that i did not really understand who was responsible for what in all this junk

epilogue. while under standard introduction to the kabbalah and judaism, it would be wrong to read this book to discover the esoteric mysticism of the kabbalah (or kabbalah, according to transcripts): indeed, rabbi adin steinsaltz he begins his book by speaking of the famous sephiroth and suggestive design of kabbalistic angelogy still loses its drive against a wealth of information difficult to

these shortcomings fade later: reflections on the torah, ritual food or shabbat, can \"read\" the jew , read its structure to be. because it lives permanently with command and prohibitions which form a backbone of the soul: the jewish religion is ontological beyond spirituality she embraces daily because it is important to man to know how to be in complete accord with its natural environment and then hope to attain holiness. however, the interested reader should know: this book is only a small taste. you can stop there and have a good first approach of judaism. but those wishing to understand more deeply the structure of jewish thought must make efforts as read, for example the book eat or lacan and judaism gerard haddad for a psychoanalytic approach of semitic religion.\\'] [\\'sylvie

ancients\" to nazis (@ 94-95). sb declared her own faith in technology to solve problems (eg, her confidence that co2-neutral cars that will be developed in china and india, @ 36), but blames others for having this faith (@ 69). she\\\\\\'s against anglo-saxon market liberalism (@ 51, 61), and in favor of it (@ 26-29, 90). she ridiculous the claim that global warming can cause both floods and desertification (@ 15), yet later argues that its effects are highly dependent on local geography (@ 119). she decries elitism (ch.3) but condemns traditional societies without any qualification (@

growth is not physically feasible on our planet, since the laws of physics show that all economic activity must create thermal or material waste. but rather than refuting - or embracing - the economist who pointed out these limitations, n. georgescu-roegen, sb simply makes the bizarre assertion that his ideas were anticipated by ivan illich (@ 72). although she mentions christian

did he not been arrested at his house. the author concludes his book noting that mesrine part of these men that even dead, we must continue to be slaughtered; again is proof that it completely misses the criminal and his goal, because in the end, it is mesrine who won the game. he died as he had announced (the \"cowboys\" have given reason), his fight against the qhs has been won (no one speaks

one wonders just what was going through the head of mr. writer / screenwriter. i feel that trying to do everything himself, mr. shyamalan is slowing. it would need to step back and ask for help to others ... and yes, \"phenomena\" is good evidence (though some still had doubts) that the quality of dialogue, and actors are well directed essential to a film. an intriguing idea, namely to create an atmosphere or have ideas of staging are not enough to make a successful feature film. hope that shyamalan will recover from this debacle and that charitable souls (and talented) arrived to help.

all that to get where? well nowhere and this is precisely the problem, it could have something but ultimately it is the great void, the scenario is also inconsistent incoherence. some scenes are extended to bursting, resulting in a film more boring to wishes. to make matters worse, the film is filled with gratuitous violence, the more free the scenes in question have no interest in

my mind, i\\\\\\'m not one to hurt me just for fun. this i am able to say is that kaleidoscope is a marvel music (just kidding of course) and it is only intended for an audience of amateur and commercial voice tracks as you can hear every weekend in french clubs. the fact of seeing him collaborate with artists such as calvin harris, tegan &amp; sara, nelly furtado, emily haines, cary brothers, priscilla ahn and so forth merely confirms this feeling to the image of what is now armin van buuren in all its prods. to the best examples i quote \"i will be here,\" \"feel it in my bones,\" \"who wants to be alone\" and in fact almost all the tracks on the album except \"kaleidoscope \"and\" fresh fruit \"are the only ones who truly stand out from others. i would therefore say that tiesto has made a mish mash of tracks pop-trance, house and electro that are inaudible to me and frankly disappointing that the part of the netherlands, but fans of commercial music will no doubt find their account. as a friend said, this album is just the business and about money even though i strongly doubt that tiesto is lacking on this side! ! in conclusion i would say that tiesto is really decided to change his style to hope to reach a greater number of listeners (had he really needed ???), it is trying one last gamble because it tired of the universe trance in which it evolves over ten years now. in any case, whether it be his last solo album before retiring, is a sacred gift for all poisoned his biggest fans and even a lack of respect for those who so aptly captured the emotion of the crowd to transcribe his music\\'] [\\'lovers of trance, like me, will certainly disappointed by this new album from master dutchman. this is a reversal electro / pop radical with a general atmosphere that draws more on the house. almost as songs sung, short cut to the fm airwaves. i frankly feel that tiësto has tried to seduce and conquer the public and the u.s. market. already, the first time it seems to me that he publishes one of his album by a major and not under black hole recordings ... and then - 1 - hurts ... 2, the artists who sing on this album are all names more or less well known on the scene internationnale current, so a good choice consensual (he tries to have its critical telerama or what ?...) and there are s \\\\\\'performers away from the tone of voice more typical of trance which he surrounded himself so far. 3, (is it a coincidence?) his new tour starts with a bang in the usa. in short, i recognize in all honesty that this album is not bad, it is very well produced and cared for, the general public it will surely welcomed but not at all what one wants listen when you like tiesto! the period golden age \"copenhagen\" seems far away now ... so maybe he had wanted this musical evolution, either, but i think the juicy contracts and the sound of the cash register are not far behind it. real shame ... however, i still taped by a single album title, the first and eponymous \"kaleidoscope\", a marvel of chill-out/downtempo that one wonders what he has done on this disc as it has fundamentally nothing to do with the rest, let alone in first

understood and known to reveal more playing. it may be affected or not but we can not deny that the foundations of this music exist in gould. this is not a question of taste but of knowledge and

to ask the right questions about the meaning of this music, the basic technique should be resolved. the difficulty in the keyboard music resides in the fact that it contains no indication of tempo or articulation. the few indications frequently taken to the standard are indeed exceptions, and bach wanted something that purpose. in orchestral music for strings and in particular, indications of bowing technique are such ubiquitous reveal precisely the intentions of the composer and help implement the polyphony. this is not the case for the keyboard. it was shown that the composers did not need it. one reason is that often at that time were assigned a string of amateurs or professional musicians but in general had not the importance of kapell meister and other masters of the keyboard instruments. knowledge of these came from extensive study and when they knew decrypt the partition without using information they have considered superfluous. the origin of this music from the protestant liturgy and songs. the joint is supposed to imitate voices. not only that but the reasons they are also associated with this liturgy. so playing a certain pattern, has the time it was understood by all that this was a reference to the cross for example. that is why this music is coded by its very nature. prof. vera nosin moscow has shown that the fugue bwv 849 detaille acceptance by christ to his destiny on the cross. there are three themes: the cross, suffering and destiny. the evolution and significance of themes during the fugue translated this episode. therefore not only play polyphony is essential but it is precisely this polyphony lies the significance of the work. then of course, the soloist may emphasize a particular aspect that the / key specificaly while respecting the time, its style and content of the work and accordingly, different interpretations can co-exist. transforming the polyphony a simple in-and-simple melody / accompaniment returns a homophonic romanticiser and obscure the content, the meaning of this music. when it comes to transcripts, it is not a problem since they are already inherently romantic. those who drive the debate on this site are a mock trial. but when it comes to bach \"urtext\" (ie the plain text unedited) is a cons-sense. these articulation rules are actually an opportunity for each artist to find and discover unknown aspects in the music so rich. there is a light years of the service offered by this cd ... so much for the solo part. but the orchestral part is no better: without architecture concerto in d minor is a long stretch repetitive. the slow movement is sticky romanticism and final homophonic is a festival of bad taste and poor pianism. on behalf of the \"musical diversity\" is a commercial

sack and make a complete series at last . that\\\\\\'s the only reason why someone will not buy these cheap sets of precisely not precisely high fidelity music, not precisely containing \"what a wonderful world\" and \"hello dolly\". so, if this was aimed to collectors and music lovers, some of the decisions made here are very hard to accept, and some ommis are hard to believe. for instance, if you call a complete set, you do not begin by excluding the items you dislike. whoever buys a complete multi-disc series wants to have everything and judge for himself / herself. and many unexplainable things are missing from here. these are the ones i noticed: 1) many of louis\\\\\\' recordings with fletcher henderson. all of the master takes, including those which one solo louis and those on which he did, are also already in the french \"classics\" series. all of the tunes on which he soloed along with their corresponding alternate takes were on the two-volume king jazz series. so, here was the real deal al those putting together and add the alternates for the titles on louis which was not really featured. but the producers of the series fremeaux decided to exclude many

as more and more blatant: giulio cesare, cosi fan tutte, croesus, griselda and seasons, its hard for me (and his record of haydn symphonies with a fabulous oxford). however, his leadership has been a

the prague is treated more equally. the shadows may be too blurred in the original adagio and andante in (which is too chopped and hammered in his statement to sing) because of consistently fast tempos too. the allegro is enthusiastic and remarkably well executed tempo yet demonic, which says a lot about the quality of the phalanx. but there we perceive the shadows and light with much evidence that in some other versions? i think not. a more moderate tempo would surely helped the movement to speak in any ambiguity. comes the final again the movement\\\\\\'s most compelling, treated

the strange dualism between that heritage and its modern electronic inflections characteristic of the tormented world of bjork, who captivates me. the merger of the cold and tribal electronica (including five years or pluto) and the warmth of beautiful arrangements of classical strings gives a result of contrasts extremely original and ingenious, and emblematic of icelandic landscapes: steep, difficult to master, and glacial hot, short, breathtaking. finally, the voice, percussive musical element in björk, which is disconcerting personality: there sees some form of madness (his way of singing his colorful collection of human relationships the accents paranoid), a quality that always fascinates me as a woman in the field of art. and why \"homogenic\" more than \"start\" or

of \"b-sides\", in my opinion), which can not be dissociated. those 2 albums are made of the same \"base material\". probably recorded at the same time or almost (i admit my ignorance on this point since i read any newspaper article about it). 8 tracks in total, including 2 ( \"lost\" and \"lovers in japan\") are re-balanced shamelessly almost identically from the album \"viva la vida ...\" to it. personally, i find the version sung \"life in technicolor\", better than the original version that was instrumental (intro it was a nice concert, but hey ... nothing more). she has gained a little extra soul. - \"postcards from far away\" is a pretty little melody on the piano (really) ... but 48 seconds! - \"glass of water\" is not bad . the chorus in particular is very catchy and gives off a

wide audience) invades the landscape, korn consolidates what had begun faith no more, body count, or rage against the machine, and became the spearhead of nu metal. mtv broadcast of independent rock, but what we then called the big beat (the prodigy, the chemical brothers ...) and the metal was not relegated to late hours. so naturally i expected out of the spawn soundtrack fervently. following the concept introduced by the soundtrack to exit a few years ago (on which every song was a collaboration between an artist came and a rap came from the metal / grunge), on the spawn soundtrack we had 14 collaborations between artists of different backgrounds come of electronic music in vogue at the time and an artist came from the rock as we saw on mtv . the casting was very heavy, especially from the rock: tom morello (ratm), metallica, korn, marilyn manson, silverchair ... quite a few names a little older now, but still retain a reputation undeniable. the electronic side, the cast was not bad either, although some artists are just left to rot since, moby, orbital, dj spooky, roni size, goldie, the crystal method ... although more motivated by cash flow as driven by genuine artistic intent, this album does not end in the annals of music had nevertheless broken the barriers between rock music and consumer electronics, today totally barriers missing. as in any compilation bringing large windfalls, they will always find some groups with fewer vendors and labels would enhance, but not necessarily less good (i think of stabbing westward), few groups that do not reasons that sometimes only a teenager can understand (here i think to filter, to which the source of my animosity still incomprehensible to me) and some tracks on space-filling sound that the invention of the cd had allowed easy to zap when listening, in contrast to the tedious fast forward the tape (there i think mansun &amp; 808 state). as always, some cannibalized their employee so that one wonders what was the contribution of a group (again, i think that korn does not leave the dust brothers that some parts of synthetic discrete). even then, i was not fooled and knew full well that most artists had not even met, each doing its part to his side and there was no osmosis and creative effervescent in a studio during the nights (which seems particularly evident on for whom the bell tolls by metallica and dj spooky that is ultimately a drum &amp; bass remix of the song by metallica). but in all this compilation was innovative, it fulfilled its mission, my ears adolescent rebellion found their account, some songs were really good, i tell myself that some groups were truly made to meet (the prodigy associated guitarist of rage against the machine, it could only paste) and then one of the major

fourth cd collection \"jazz in paris\" dedicated to henri crolla is by far the least interesting. to apreciate this artist, it is better to buy the number 80 \"begin the beguine\" or 89 \"when the white lilacs bloom again.\" only for fans of \"millipede\"!\\'] [\"applause from all over to hercules and love affair. critical success, good sales, a symbiosis of the time. but what\\'s behind this phenomenon came from nowhere, or almost? rhythms 80s, synth sounds strapped to a disco with funk guitar, a voice as recognizable as that of jimmy sommerville, and good compositions. first response : genres do not die, they recycle, as modes. bridgehead success of hercules, blind, first single from the album. a strong line and glittering, guitar (funk so), and a refrain that comes into your head:\\'\\'because i feel blind because i feeel-blind\\'\\'. second answer: potential hits solid gold mark lalbum. raise me up is the same mold as blind. but hercules did not scuttled the sauce by turning the boney m. true false / fake real lalbum shade, a real work of voice, superb stereo, on a trip funk scripted that gradually becomes a fantastic cruise. third answer: is a really good music behind the child. finally, quiet side include the beautiful iris, more contemporary, pink, playing tones and tones with a raised voice relaxed and relaxing. ultimately, hercules and love affair tells a lovely history, said in a nice way, with the means available. a very hard and shifted, especially unexpected, and this adds to its charm. no wonder when it meets this well deserved success is a true album of our time.\"] [\\'if you love rock music and especially live albums, if you like concerts full of sweat and passion of youth, this album is for you. recorded in 1978 during the tour \"let there be rock\", this disc is a tribute to rock music. the atmosphere that emerges is a concentrate that could be rock concerts, from elvis presley to the rolling stones, from led zeppelin or the clash. amps buzz with saturation pressure at its maximum (see the beginning of \"riff raff\"), the battery is fiercely ax, low strongly reinforces the rhythm and the singer bawling. the riffs are simple, the ooze blues solos and speed the pace is not one-can-plus-binary. in the late seventies ac / dc was the essence of rock, it does not meet even the stadiums, but the smoky concert halls, and with its hard-boogie furious, he was promised a huge success what the next album \"highway to hell\" was confirmed. \"if you want blood\" is really a live exceptional and more perfectly represent the band\\\\\\'s career since its inception 4 years ago by combining its best tracks, it is also and primarily the only live album that ac / dc have released the lifetime of his now legendary singer bon scott.\\'] [\"parts &amp; labor is an indie rock band rather classic dan friel if there was not full of sounds incongruous and strident. so when he goes to an album all alone on its side with its sounds that make furious parts &amp; labor wildly original, it\\'s enough jumping frantically as a child before the christmas tree. and the result is frisky and joyfully frenetic. synth abusing children with diverse and varied effects as to make them spit out sounds that resemble the sound of a fax or an old 56k modem, he managed to compose songs really catchy at the limit of infantilism but swimming in a bath with essential oils of saturation. it is as if the cartoon channel was parasitized by the snow, a sight and strident faces of aphex twin.\"] [\\'all of them are made for us the good news. social media, of course, but it was expected, telerama, wishing to remain in the game but also rock\\\\\\'n folk, france inter, libe, tv entertainment, rustica, pif gadget or even jokes

finally all macumba clubs in the world, are therefore entitled under saviors of electro. to the ear, the case is much more difficult. the single \"dance\" unlikely tweaking a song for summer camps and rhythmic compressed, released just before the summer was a harbinger of an even more catastrophic album that everything we could think reasonably. what critics there are almost all gone in their chronic jingle like \"there will always be grumpy to say that justice, which comes out of nowhere, is a major media coup when they are cute boys\" would obviously have put us a flea in his ear. so nobody besides them, little lucky columnists, had heard this album, we already shouted at caballe anti-justice and they threw discredit on potential opponents. the album, -nothing but the title is a concept, man! - then unpacks 12 tracks of electro-winded enough, dominated by rhythmic stuffed with setbacks and breaks exhausting that enslave most musical sequences. the result is a severe shortage of melodies and linearity factual fatigue quickly. in fact the soundtrack of summer, it ends up with a compilation of jingles that will probably support the trailers of tf1 for the summer. ..
